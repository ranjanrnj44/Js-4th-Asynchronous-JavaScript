                                                                                                                await. The second timer is not created until the first has already fired, so the code finishes after 3 seconds.

                                                                                                                In concurrentStart, both timers are created and then awaited. The timers run concurrently, which means the code
                                                                                                                finishes in 2 rather than 3 seconds, i.e. the slowest timer.
                                                                                                                However, the await calls still run in series, which means the second await will wait for the first one to
                                                                                                                finish. In this case, the result of the fastest timer is processed after the slowest.

                                                                                                                If you wish to safely perform two or more jobs in parallel, you must await a call to Promise.all, or
