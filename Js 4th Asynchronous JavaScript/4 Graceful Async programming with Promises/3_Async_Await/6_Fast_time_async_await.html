        // Define custom promise function

        /*
        Here we store the three Promise objects in variables, which has the effect of setting off their associated
        processes all running simultaneously.

        Next, we await their results â€” because the promises all started processing at essentially the same time, the
        promises will all fulfill at the same time; when you run the second example, you'll see the alert box reporting
        a total run time of just over 3 seconds!

        You'll have to test your code carefully, and bear this in mind if performance starts to suffer.

        Another minor inconvenience is that you have to wrap your awaited promises inside an async function.
